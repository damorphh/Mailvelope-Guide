# Mailvelope-Guide
Guide on how to quickly set up mailvelope, for people who have used it before but are on a new computer, for me and my friends.

## Download extension
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mailvelope/)
[Edge Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mailvelope/dgcbddhdhjppfdfjpciagmmibadmoapc)
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mailvelope/kajibbejlbohfaggdiogboambcijhkke)
In my experience the Edge Store is more reliable than the Chrome Store, use it if you can.

## Import private keys
This guide assumes you have set this up before.
Import your `name_all.asc` or `name_private.asc` from when you had exported your keys before.

## Send an email
1. Go to extension page
2. Press encrypt (at the top)
3. Enter the email of the person you are sending it to (assuming their email has been uploaded to the mailvelope or GnuGPG servers)
4. Click `Do you also want to encrypt a text?`
5. Enter text
6. Click encrypt
7. Copy text
8. Paste into email
